    WordCloud comes as a component that can be invoked from any visualforce page. You must pass it the object type to build the cloud for. The rest is optional.
    objectType: the type of sObject to get data from to power the word cloud
    fields: the records on the objects who's content will be used to create the cloud. Must be comma separated
    records: a list of ids which to query for. If none is provided all records of the objectType are queried
    skipwords: words that will not be included in the word cloud no matter how many times they appear. 
    lowerbound: the minimum number of times a word must appear in the text before it is displayed in the cloud.
    grid: word spacing; smaller is more tightly packed but takes longer
    factor: font resizing factor; default "0" means automatically fill the container
    normalize: reduces outlier weights for a more attractive output
    shape: shape of the cloud. Must be one of "circle", "square", "diamond", "triangle", "triangle-forward", "x", "pentagon" or "star"
    font: font family, identical to CSS font-family attribute
    width: width of the cloud. Can be a percent or pixel/inch amount.
    height: height of the cloud. Must be a pixel or inch amount.
    backgroundColor: a hexidecimal (#000000) or string color value. Use 'transparent' for no background
    colorTheme: theme for word colors. Use 'dark' or 'light'
    autoRefresh: automatically refresh the cloud after a specified interval?
    refreshInterval: interval (in seconds) after which the cloud is automatically refreshed
